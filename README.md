This code is a basic clock application built using the tkinter library in Python. It allows users to view the current time in different time zones, set alarms, reminders, and view the calendar.
The clock displays the current time in digital format along with the date. Users can select a timezone from a dropdown list that includes some of the major time zones. The clock updates every second, displaying the current time in the selected timezone.
Users can click the “Show Calendar” button to display the calendar for the current month.
Users can set an alarm by clicking the “Set Alarm” button, which opens a new window where they can enter the hour and minute for the alarm. The alarm will sound and a message will be displayed on the screen when the specified time is reached.
Users can set a reminder by clicking the “Set Reminder” button, which will allow them to enter a title and description for the reminder.
Users can exit the application by clicking the “Exit” button.
Overall, this code provides a basic clock application with additional functionality to set alarms and reminders and view the calendar.
